# recipe website 
by: Nidhi Parmar

This repository is dedicated to a project/website I worked on which consists of a homepage, 
a recipe page and a dessert page made using only XHTML and CSS.

Program1.html = homepage.
Recipe.html = a recipe page for a greek garbonzo salad.
Dessert.html = summer fruit crostata dessert recipe.
program1.css = the css for the three webpages above.
